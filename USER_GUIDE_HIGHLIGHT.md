## Troubleshooting

### Highlight not appearing?
- Make sure the Highlight tool is active (button should be highlighted)
- Check that you're clicking and dragging, not just clicking
- Try pressing 'H' to reactivate the tool

### Highlight is too thin?
- The default thickness is 3x the pen stroke width
- This is intentional for the highlighter effect
- Future updates will include adjustable thickness

### Color not changing?
- Make sure you select a new color BEFORE drawing
- Already-drawn highlights keep their original color
- The color picker only affects new highlights

### Cannot move or resize highlights?
- This is expected behavior
- Highlights are permanent once drawn (like pen strokes)
- Use the Select tool ('V') for annotations that can be edited
- Use shapes (rectangles, circles) if you need resizable highlights

### Highlights look too light?
- The 40% opacity is intentional for realistic highlighting
- Draw multiple strokes over the same area for darker emphasis
- Or use the Pen tool for fully opaque drawing
